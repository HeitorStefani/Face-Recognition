<p align="left">The usability of this project is quite simple and can be adapted for different purposes, such as implementing a login facilitated by facial recognition. However, I do not recommend using this version in production, as there are still several vulnerabilities that need to be fixed to ensure the necessary security in a real environment. This project was created with the main objective of improving my knowledge of JavaScript and exploring my curiosity about how the language can be used for facial recognition.</p>
